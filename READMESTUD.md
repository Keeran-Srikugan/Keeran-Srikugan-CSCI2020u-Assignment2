The purpose of this assignment is to create a server where files can be interchanged via upload or download between the clients
machine and the server machine. To run this assignment, you will have to begin by running the server file first, then the FileServerClient
file. After the FileServerClient file has compiled, a UI will appear where the client files are placed on the left and the server files are
placed on the right.Server files can be downloaded by the client while client files can be uploaded by the client. For this code to run, after
cloning, you will need to import the javafx library and add javafx to vm options.
